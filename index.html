<!-- Hydrology Overview -->
<div class="section" id="hydroOverview">
    <h2>1. Hydrology Overview</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hydrology is the scientific study of the movement, distribution, and properties of water on Earth, including its environmental impact. The hydrological cycle, which includes processes like evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and transpiration, plays a central role in hydrology.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Hydrological Cycle -->
<div class="section" id="hydroCycle">
    <h2>2. Hydrological Cycle</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The hydrological cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It involves several stages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Evaporation:</span> The process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas or vapor state due to heat energy from the sun.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Condensation:</span> The process by which water vapor in the atmosphere cools and changes back into liquid form, forming clouds.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Precipitation:</span> The release of condensed water from clouds in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail, which falls to the Earth's surface.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Infiltration:</span> The process by which precipitation seeps into the soil and replenishes groundwater reserves.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Runoff:</span> The movement of excess water over the land surface into rivers, lakes, and oceans, ultimately completing the cycle.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Water Movement Pathways -->
<div class="section" id="waterMovement">
    <h2>3. Water Movement Pathways</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Water moves through various pathways on Earth's surface and subsurface, including interception by vegetation, infiltration into soil and groundwater, evapotranspiration from plants, and surface runoff into rivers and lakes. These pathways are integral to the hydrological cycle and have significant implications for water resource management and environmental sustainability.</p>

        <p>Stormwater management involves the implementation of various strategies and practices to control, treat, and mitigate the adverse effects of stormwater runoff on the environment and human infrastructure. Techniques include green infrastructure, detention basins, permeable pavements, and best management practices (BMPs) aimed at reducing flooding, erosion, and pollution in urban and rural areas.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Impact of Land Development -->
<div class="section" id="landDevelopmentImpact">
    <h2>8. Impact of Land Development</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The impact of land development on hydrology and hydraulics refers to the alterations in water flow patterns, infiltration rates, and flood risks resulting from urbanization, deforestation, and other land-use changes. Increased impervious surfaces, altered flow velocities, and reduced infiltration capacity are among the primary consequences of land development, necessitating careful planning and management of water resources.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Drainage Systems and Regulatory Standards -->
<div class="section" id="drainageSystems">
    <h2>9. Drainage Systems and Regulatory Standards</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Drainage systems are infrastructure networks designed to manage stormwater runoff and prevent flooding in urban and rural areas. Regulatory standards and guidelines govern the design, construction, and maintenance of drainage systems to ensure public safety, environmental protection, and sustainable water management. Key aspects include minimum platform levels, drainage reserves, and compliance with local building codes and regulations.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Rainfall -->
<div class="section" id="rainfall">
    <h2>10. Rainfall</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Rainfall is the residue of precipitation found in streams, rivers, lakes, and underground. It's crucial to keep records of rainfall for various purposes such as estimating water quantity, water resource planning, and flood control studies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rainfall Volume Calculation: Rainfall Volume = Rainfall Depth Ã— Area</li>
            <li>Rainfall Intensity: Measured in mm/h, mm/min, or in/h. Short durations have high intensity, while long durations have low intensity.</li>
            <li>Duration: Total time during which rainfall occurs, used to calculate the total volume of rainfall.</li>
            <li>Intensity: Rate of rainfall at any instant, measured in depth of water per unit time.</li>
            <li>Depth: Total amount of water accumulated.</li>
            <li>Frequency: Average number of times a rainfall of a given intensity and duration is likely to occur in one year.</li>
            <li>Return Period: Average time interval between occurrences of a rainfall event of a given magnitude or intensity.</li>
            <li>Hyetograph: Graphical representation of rainfall intensity over time.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Recurrence Level & Probability of Occurrence -->
<div class="section" id="recurrenceLevel">
    <h2>11. Recurrence Level & Probability of Occurrence</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Hydrological events like rainfall, its intensity, and duration exhibit no definite regularity and are random in nature. Determining the occurrence of storms of specific intensities and durations involves analyzing many years of rainfall records using statistical methods.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recurrence Interval or Return Period: The time span between identical storms, determined from historical data. For example, a 5-year storm has a return period of 5 years.</li>
            <li>Probability of Occurrence: Calculated using the recurrence interval. For instance, the probability of a 5-year storm occurring in any single year is P = 1/5 = 0.2 or 20%.</li>
            <li>Comparison: The larger the recurrence interval (N), the less likely it is for a hydrological event to occur in a given year. Therefore, a 50-year storm is less likely to occur than a 10-year storm.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) Relationships -->
<div class="section" id="idfRelationships">
    <h2>12. Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) Relationships</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Data on storm intensity, duration, and frequency are crucial for designing urban drainage and predicting peak flows in rivers. Knowing the severity and frequency of droughts is important for designing water supply schemes like reservoirs.</p>
        <p>Storms of shorter durations typically have higher average intensities than longer storms. For a given duration, higher intensities correspond to storms with longer recurrence intervals.</p>

<!-- Design Considerations -->
<div class="section" id="designConsiderations">
    <h2>13. Design Considerations</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Stormwater management and drainage system design must consider the peak runoff that occurs when a catchment receives uniform rainfall. The peak runoff is calculated at the point of design when the entire catchment is contributing to the outflow at this point.</p>
        <p>Important design criteria include ensuring minimum velocity for self-cleansing, avoiding excessive scouring, and providing freeboard to prevent overflow.</p>
