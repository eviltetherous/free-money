    <h1>Hydrology & Hydraulics Overview</h1>
    <h2>1. Introduction to Hydrology</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Hydrology</span> is the scientific study of water's properties, distribution, and effects on the earth's surface, soils, and atmosphere. It encompasses the study of the hydrological cycle, water resources, and environmental watershed sustainability.</p>

    <h2>2. The Hydrological Cycle</h2>
    <p>This cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. The process is significant due to its role in the distribution of water resources.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Precipitation</span>: Moisture released from clouds.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Interception</span>: Water caught by plant leaves.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Infiltration</span>: Water soaks into the soil.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Surface Runoff</span>: Water flows over the land.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Evapotranspiration</span>: Water evaporates from surfaces and transpires from plants.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Water Movement</h2>
    <p>Water moves in various ways, significantly affecting hydrological and environmental outcomes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Throughfall</span> and <span class="highlight">Stemflow</span>: Water pathways in vegetation areas.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Groundwater Flow</span>: Movement through soil layers and aquifers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Rainfall Analysis</h2>
    <p>Understanding rainfall patterns is crucial for managing water resources and mitigating flood risks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Intensity, Duration, and Frequency</span>: Key metrics that determine the impact of rainfall events.</li>
        <li>Measurement Tools: <span class="highlight">Rain Gauges</span> collect and measure rainfall.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Runoff Analysis</h2>
    <p>Runoff is part of the water cycle, involving the flow of water from land to water bodies, and is influenced by several factors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Soil type, land topography, and vegetation</span> are crucial in determining runoff volume and speed.</li>
        <li>Methodologies like the <span class="highlight">Rational Method</span> are used to estimate peak discharge from small catchment areas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Probability and Recurrence Intervals</h2>
    <p>These concepts are essential in hydrological predictions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Recurrence Interval</span>: The average time between events (like heavy rainfalls).</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Probability of Occurrence</span>: Calculated to assess the risk of hydrological events.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Stormwater Management</h2>
    <p>Effective stormwater management is crucial for reducing runoff and improving water quality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Detention and Retention Basins</span>: Structures that manage runoff and mitigate its effects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Drainage Systems Design</h2>
    <p>Drainage systems are designed to manage water efficiently, ensuring safety and functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Hydraulic Design</span>: Considers factors like pipe flow capacity and network layout.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Hydrographs</h2>
    <p>A hydrograph plots the rate of flow versus time for a given point on a stream or river, particularly useful for predicting future water scenarios.</p>

    <h2>10. Environmental and Urban Impacts</h2>
    <p>Development significantly affects hydrological systems:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Urbanization</span> increases runoff and reduces infiltration, exacerbating flood risks.</li>
        <li>Mitigation Techniques: <span class="highlight">Green infrastructures</span> like permeable pavements and rain gardens.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Key Formulas</h1>
    <h3>General Formulas</h3>
    <p class="formula">Qp = C x i x A (Rational Method Formula)</p>
    <p class="formula">Rainfall Volume = Rainfall Depth x Area</p>
    <h3>Hydrograph Related</h3>
    <p class="formula">Q = A x V (Flow rate calculation)</p>
    <p class="formula">tc = to + td (Time of concentration)</p>
    <h3>Runoff Coefficients</h3>
    <p class="formula">C (Urban areas) = 0.9 to 0.95</p>
    <p class="formula">C (Rural areas) = 0.05 to 0.30 depending on vegetation and soil type</p>
